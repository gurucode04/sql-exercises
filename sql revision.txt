1. CREATE TABLE: Create the Customers table with the structure provided. Ensure that the customer_id is set as the primary key.

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    city VARCHAR(50),
    join_date DATE,
);

2. CREATE TABLE: Create the Orders table, setting up the foreign key constraint for customer_id to reference the Customers table.

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

3. ALTER TABLE: Add a new column phone_number to the Customers table, ensuring it has a unique constraint.

ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD phone_number VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE;

4. DELETE: Delete records from the Customers table where the customer’s city is unknown or set to NULL.

DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE city IS NULL;

5. UPDATE: Increase the total_amount of all orders placed after January 1, 2024, by 10%.

UPDATE Orders
SET total_amount = total_amount * 1.10
WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01';

6. UPDATE: Write a query to update the stock_quantity in Products for a product supplied by 'ABC Suppliers' to 50.

update products
set stock_quantity = 50
where supplier_id = 301;

7. Constraints: Modify the Products table to add a check constraint that ensures price is greater than 0.

ALTER TABLE Products
ADD CONSTRAINT check_price_positive CHECK (price > 0);

8. WHERE Clause: Retrieve all customers from the Customers table who joined after July 1, 2023, and reside in the city "New York".

select first_name, last_name from customers
where join_date > '2023-07-01' and city = 'New York';

9. WHERE Clause: Find all products that have a stock_quantity less than 10.

select * from products
where stock_quantity < 10;

10. DISTINCT: Retrieve a list of unique cities where suppliers are located.

select distinct(city) from suppliers;

11. ORDER BY: Write a query to retrieve all orders in the Orders table, sorted by order_date in descending order.

select * from orders
order by order_date desc;

12. ORDER BY: Retrieve all products sorted by price in ascending order, but list products with the same supplier_id together.

SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY supplier_id, price ASC;

13. GROUP BY: Calculate the total total_amount spent by each customer, grouping by customer_id.

SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

14. GROUP BY: Retrieve the average price of products provided by each supplier and only include suppliers with at least 3 products.

SELECT supplier_id, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM Products
GROUP BY supplier_id
HAVING COUNT(product_id) >= 3;

15. HAVING Clause: List suppliers with an average product_price of more than $200. Use GROUP BY and HAVING clauses.

SELECT supplier_id, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM Products
GROUP BY supplier_id
HAVING AVG(price) > 200;

16. UPDATE with WHERE: Update the price of all products to match the average price of products in their category if their current price is below this average.

UPDATE Products p
SET p.price = (
    SELECT AVG(price)
    FROM Products
    WHERE category_id = p.category_id
)
WHERE p.price < (
    SELECT AVG(price)
    FROM Products
    WHERE category_id = p.category_id
);

17. Complex Query with GROUP BY and HAVING: Write a query to find customers who have spent more than the average spending of all customers. Use GROUP BY and HAVING.

SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > (SELECT AVG(total_amount) FROM Orders);

18. CREATE TABLE with DEFAULT Constraint: Create a new table called Reviews to store product reviews. Include the following columns:
review_id (Primary Key),
product_id (Foreign Key referencing Products),
customer_id (Foreign Key referencing Customers),
rating (an integer with a DEFAULT value of 3),
review_text.

CREATE TABLE Reviews (
    review_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    rating INT DEFAULT 3,
    review_text TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

19. Modify the Products table to add a new column, product_category, with an ENUM constraint to allow only the following categories: 'Electronics', 'Accessories', and 'Home Office'.

ALTER TABLE Products
ADD product_category ENUM('Electronics', 'Accessories', 'Home Office');

20. In the Orders table, add a new column quantity with a CHECK constraint to ensure it only allows values greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100.

ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD quantity INT CHECK (quantity > 0 AND quantity <= 100);

21. Alter the Orders table to set the order_date column with a DEFAULT value of the current date.

ALTER TABLE Orders
MODIFY order_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

ALTER TABLE Orders
MODIFY order_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE;

22. Add a payment_method column to the Orders table with an ENUM constraint allowing only 'Credit Card', 'Debit Card', 'PayPal', and 'Cash'. Set the default payment method to 'Credit Card'.

ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD payment_method ENUM('Credit Card', 'Debit Card', 'PayPal', 'Cash') DEFAULT 'Credit Card';

23.	Create a new table called Inventory to track product stock with columns:
•	location_id (Primary Key),
•	product_id (Primary Key, Foreign Key referencing Products),
•	stock_level (Default value of 0),
•	last_restocked_date.
Add a CHECK constraint to ensure that stock_level is never negative.

CREATE TABLE Inventory (
    location_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    stock_level INT DEFAULT 0 CHECK (stock_level >= 0),
    last_restocked_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (location_id, product_id),
